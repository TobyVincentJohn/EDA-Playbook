# EDA-Playbook
A comprehensive cheatsheet for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python. This repository includes commonly used techniques, visualizations, and code snippets to help data scientists and analysts quickly analyze and understand their data.
# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process. It helps uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. This cheatsheet provides an easy reference to the most common EDA techniques used in Python.
